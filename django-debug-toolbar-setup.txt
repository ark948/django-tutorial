venv>pip install django-debug-toolbar

(does not support async views)

1. check if 'django.contrib.staticfiles' is in INSTALLED_APPS setting. (done)
2. and it is configured properly (if STATIC_URL exists probably enough) (done)

3. ensure TEMPLATES setting contains DjangoTemplates backend whose APP_DIRS option is set to True (done)

4. Add "debug_toolbar" to INSTALLED_APPS.(done)
(i added it as the last in the list)

5. Add urls to project's URLConf (done)

6. Add the middleware (in MIDDLEWARE setting) (done)
(the order of middleware is important, should come as early as possible, but after any middleware)
(that encodes response's content, such as GZipMiddleware)

7. Configure Internal IPsÔÉÅ(done)
(if using docker, will need further confguration)

(install was successful, debug toolbar does show up in index page, but not in polls app index page)
(let's add it to polls urls as well.)
(no, still not showing)
