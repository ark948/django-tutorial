so the tutorial is over. and now i'm going to further improve this project.
and once ready start a new one.

here i will list features and fixes i will try to implement.

1. first page shows nothing. How to make polls' index page, the only index page?
(reconsidering, i will add a main app, just like flask)
- successfully added main app. now trying to use it as the main index page.
- successfully added main app as main index but now http://127.0.0.1:8000/main/ returns not found.
How to keep them both? is it even necessary? let's just try.
- successfully kept them both.

2. How to use inheritance in django template system?
done - (but i'm keeping base.html outside inner main folder)

3. Added static to main

4. Add a link from main homepage to polls app. (done)

5. Time for user authentication and management
(since django comes with a user management and autorization system...)
(i won't make an auth app. just use it in main app)
